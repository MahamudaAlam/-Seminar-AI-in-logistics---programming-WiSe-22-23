In this project, i have built a Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100, and ask the user to guess the number. The program will provide feedback to the user on whether their guess was too high or too low, and keep track of the number of guesses it took the user to find the correct answer.
This program starts off with a greeting message, followed by the importation of the random library to generate a random number between 1 and 100.
It includes a function to facilitate gameplay, giving the user the option to select how many chances they want to take. After that it will tell the user put a input or quit the game at any time.
Then a code is written that compares the user's input to the randomly generated number, providing feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. If the user successfully guesses the number, a congratulatory message is printed.
Finally, if the user runs out of attempts, the program displays the number of attempts made and reveals the correct answer.
